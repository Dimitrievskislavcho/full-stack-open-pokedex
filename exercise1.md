Topic: Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building.
What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by Google.

Opinion: We could pick Jest or React Testing library to configure and run tests for the given Project. Eslint can be used as a linter before building.
The building itself can be done using Vite since it is easy to setup and it comes with many batteries included.

Topic: What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask Google!

Opinion: As an alternataive to Jenkins and GitHub Actions, Circle CI can be used since it is cloud based and has very nice and well rounded features for notifying on/after build and
is easy to use.

Topic: Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

Opinion: Most important thing here is knowledge/experience in setting up self-hosted environments. If cloud based requires less of those and can be setup
faster and if the cost is not too higher than a self-hosted one it could be a better solution.
